                            <div class="faq-description expand-description">BSPA takes a broad view of Behavioral Science, describing it as the cross-disciplinary science of understanding the causes of individual, group and organizational behavior across different levels. Behavioral Science encompasses the social sciences, and brings together insights and methods from a variety of fields and disciplines, for example judgement and decision-making, behavioral economics, organizational behavior, neuroscience, and social and cognitive psychology. Under the umbrella of Behavioral Science, these disciplines, which separately do not provide a complete picture of human behavior, offer a comprehensive toolkit to bridge the gap between economic models and everyday reality to shape both private- and public-sector policy and practice.</div>
